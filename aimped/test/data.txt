whose primary medical concerns a history of coronary artery disease.

Patient Private information:
Social Security no: 444-66-4423
DLN # AB977535A
Address: 787 Everett Street, Marianna, Florida
e-mail: kvincente@gdynamic.com

ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 55-year old man with multiple medical 
problems coming in for follow-up.
1.   Hypertension - the patient will stay on his Zestril and will use 
     Hytrin now, both for his hypertension, as well as benign prostatic 
     hypertrophy
2.   The patient will stay on Hytrin for now
3.   Coronary artery disease - the patient's cholesterol is 190 with a 
     slightly above average triglycerides, which is more than acceptable 
     for this gentleman.  I do not have an HDL in which to judge his 
     ratio, but I was by the patient before that it runs in the high 40s
